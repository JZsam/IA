* Read me for IA
  You might be confused why you are here it is because I'm too lazy to put everything into a Google Drive folder so here is my GitLab Repository. This is live, so you will have constant access throughout my development on it including the writing part. 
** Where Things are
   At first this repository looks scary, but it is not. Here are all the important parts of this repository.
   - The IA document | ~document/IA.pdf~
   - The code directory | ~src/main/java/com/jzdoot/IA/~

** How to run
   This part is a little difficult you will need to clone this repository in a local directory and import it into Eclipse or VS Code
*** Eclipse
	1. On the top bar click ~File->Import...~
	2. In the file tree go to ~Git->Project From Git(with smart import)~
	3. Click on ~Clone URI~
	4. In the URI box past ~https://gitlab.com/jzdoot/ia.git~
