	\section{Criterion A: Planning}
	\subsection{Defining the Problem}
		The problem of Mr. Todd Fessler (my client) is that for our marching band class there is no good and efficient way of taking attendance. The way of taking attendance right now is that the “Drum Majors” who are the overall leaders in the marching band, go around and ask each row for their attendance, and it took a very long time to take attendance.
		\subsection{Rational for Proposed Solution}
			My solution will make it possible for the leaders of each row to take attendance then the Drum Majors won’t have to go row by row. This will also skip the Drum Major step completely since my client will have direct accesses to the app. This will make it easier for everyone and faster, so we can have a longer rehearsal times.
		\subsection{Success Criterion}
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tabular}{|l|}
					\hline
					Different classes each level of leaders\\
					\hline
					A web app will be created add the different levels can edit different kinds of pages\\
					\hline
					Make it accessible from a phone\\

					Make it accessible from an iPad\\
					\hline
					Make it accessible from a laptop/computer\\

		\subsection{Flowchart}
			This is the basic flow of the updateBand method \\ \\
			\includegraphics[width=6in]{IA UML and Flowchart-Flowchart.jpg}
		\subsection{Pseudocode}
			For the pseudocode I will be writing out the updateBand method
			\begin{verbatim}
				item = read in a file for every section that stops in a comma
				while there is a next item
					if tem%6 equals 0 
						spot = item
						if its k-row
							row = first 2 letter
						else
							row = first letter
					if temp%6 equals 1
						name = item + " "
					if temp%6 equals 2
						name += item
					if temp%6 equals 3
						section = item
					if temp%6 equals 4
						grade = item
					if temp%6 equals 5
						new object t of type Top(spot, row, name, section, grade, item)
					temp++
			\end{verbatim}
		\subsection{Development Plan}
			This is a plan for how to create the final product
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Create the Bandie class and the other levels of authorization all the way to Director/Admin
				\item Write the Row class with the hash table for the whole row’s attendance and a linked list for the Bandies in the Row
				\item Create the Band class with the linked list for the directors and another linked list for the rows
				\item Create the Attendance class to store the past and current attendance for each Bandie
				\item Be able to upload a new CSV file to upload the structure of the band
				\item Store past attendance for each Bandie in a CSV file
				\item Make a web app that will ...
					\begin{enumerate}
						\item Have a login screen where any level above Bandie has a password
						\item Have the different screens for Bandies, Squad Leaders, and Drum Majors.
						\item For Directors, they will also have a Statistics page with a tagline at the top(refer to the Sketch above)
					\end{enumerate}
			\end{itemize}

					\end{itemize}
					\\
					\hline \\
					\Large Uploading a spreed sheet file &
					\begin{itemize}
						\item If the file is not a CSV file then will pass an error to the user "Improper File type"
						\item If the file is a CSV but is not properly formatted it will pass an error to the user "Improper formatted"
						\item If the file is a CSV and the first line is properly formatted it will upload the file

		\subsection{Program Structure}
		\subsection{Techniques Used}
		% \subsection{Hash table (Kind Of)}
		% 	I used a broken down hash table. A hash table is an array of linked list, I made my own class that used a linked list called Row and another class called Band which used an array of Rows to store each member of the band. I create an object called Row which is a linked list and using an array of Rows in my Band class I made a broken down hash table. This hash table is being used for the storage of all the members of the band. To reset the hash table I have made two methods one side is in the Band class and the Director class
		% 	\subsection{Reading a File}
		% 		I am reading an CSV file using scanner. CSV is a file formatted with data seporated with commas and new lines. I'm using Scanner to go through the CSV file and I can do it easily by setting the delimiter to a comma I can easlly go through the entire file and stop at every stop. A CSV file can be edited through a spreadsheet editor.

	\section{Appendix A: Interview}
		Interview conducted in person
		Interview 1 initial information gathering

		Student - Basically my plan right now for the for the program is there's going to be different tiers. So, there’s going to be a squad leader tier, a drum major tier, and then a director/admin tier. Squad leaders will be able to change attendance within the row, for Drum Major will be able to change attendance for the entire band and then for directors they can change the attendance for the entire band and on top of that there's some statistics like what rows haven't taken attendace yet, who turned into attendance for which row, and then maybe some row of the week stuff like most improved week to week, move most improved within the week, or best overall within the week or for the entire year. I’ll be able to collect all that kind of data just from attendance.
		Client – That’s awesome. So would it be like you're thinking, like you said squad leaders have control over their rows. 
		Student - and then drum majors the entire band and then you guys can take this for the entire band and then you guys can do attendance for the entire band and then on top of that you can look at statistics and stuff
		Client - Is there any way once like for example of this squad leaders have submitted their attendance for the day is there a way for them to update it?
		Student - I mean I could definitely implement that.
		Client - or like a way for them to update it until the end of class. Somebody shows up that's the issue I think yeah if somebody shows up late on excused then they're marked absent for the whole day but we need to know if they were late that day or if they were asking because that changes 
		Student –I can probably set up a window of time like every morning from like 7:30 to 8:30 maybe even earlier I can set it to like 7 like to whenever time the period ends nowadays. Talking about some basic structure %2:04
